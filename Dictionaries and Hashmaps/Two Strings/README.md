# Two Strings

### Scenario
Given two strings, determine if they share a common substring. A substring may be as small as one character.

For example, the words "a", "and", "art" share the common substring . The words "be" and "cat" do not share a substring.

### Note
*By using "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" string as a dictionary, the solution can be implemented without dictionary collection.
*Comparing two elements at once, it takes only O(n).
